    "### Data types\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, depending on how you typed your new number, you may actually have unintentionally told Python some additional information above. Variables can actually be saved with several different types of data:\n",
    "* Text (called a \"string\")\n",
    "* Exact, whole numerical values (integers)\n",
    "* Decimal numerical values (called \"floats\")\n",
    "\n",
    "The difference between integers and floats is quite important for computation. Computers cannot actually save infinite decimal values (because storage is finite), so to tackle numbers with a reasonable level of precision, a variable is saved to a specific number of digits. In Python, floats have 18 digits. However, if the final value of a decimal is always the same, that introduces a bias error to your computations; so instead, the computer assigns a random, \"floating\" value at the very end of the long decimal. This usually works well, but in rare cases can cause problems in computations. It helps to be aware of what a program is really doing in case you need to work around a problem!\n",
    "\n",
    "It is also the case that only certain kinds of values can be used for certain things. If you want to count the number of apples in a basket (or iterations in a repeating calculation), you want a precise integer number, like 5, not 5.000000000000001. You cannot use floats for this kind of operation. On the other hand, complex calculations rarely rely on exact integers, and usually require floats.\n",
    "\n",
    "And then there are strings! Often, it helps to use simple text for saving values, communicating information, printing to the screen, making exported tables and figures, and more. And a Python program will treat strings as simple characters, without reading any numerical values from it, even if it contains numbers. Sometimes it is necessary to change a numerical data type into a text string (or even vice versa), so you can work with it in different ways.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Exercise 2\n",

They are designed for use when it is necessary to define items in a series, which means you cannot duplicate entries, and they are arranged in pairs where one item is the \"key\" and the other is the \"value.\" The values can be strings, integers, etc. Dictionaries can be edited, and in current versions of python they are ordered.\n",

In numerical calculations, it is often useful to repeat a calculation or operation several times. This is really just iteration, something computers are particularly good at doing. A common application of iterative operations is changing an independent variable and then testing it for new results in a calculation. Writing this from scratch requires breaking down your operation into a few pieces, though:\n",

    "**NOTE 1**: This is the first time we have used a kind of syntax that is particular to the Python language, namely the \"dot operator\" (i.e., the period). Python is a language that uses objects; in fact, almost *everything* is an object, with its own attributes and methods: every constant, variable (like \"numbers\" above), or function is, in fact, an object and you can define and then use all kinds of things for them. The connection between any object and its attributes or methods is indicated by a dot (”.”) written between them.\n",
    "\n",
    "An attribute is a *property* of the object that you can retrieve (to, say, print or use in a calculation). You can define and use attributes using the syntax: `<object_name>.<attribute_name>`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, a method is a *function* that the object provides, and is set up using similar syntax (usually with parentheses so you can add specific commands and instructions for how to run the function; if you aren't going to define any of these, the parentheses are just left blank).\n",
    "\n",
    "So for example, you could define a \"class\" of functions and variables that is overall called \"dog,\" which contains individual variable objects like \"Fido.\" The dog class might include some methods you have written, like eats(), runs(), sleeps(). You could then write Fido.eats(), Fiido.runs(), Fido.sleeps(), and something would happen: some calculations or printing or other commands will run, using the Fido variable and whatever methods were previously defined. You can also define attributes for Fido, such as Fido.size = tall, or Fido.hair_color = brown, and these attributes will then be saved to the object. It takes a little practice to get used to the notation, but it works well!\n",
    "\n",
    "With this in mind, what do you think the line `numbers.append(10*i)` is actually doing? Look carefully at the code. `numbers` is a variable that you defined as a list *before* you started the loop; it starts out with just the values [10,20,30,40]. But for each pass through the loop, the `append` function is adding an element to the end of `numbers` that is equal to a value ($i$) times 10."

This is often the case when looking up examples of how to write code: they were written for some other purpose, but there is still something useful in how it is set up if you can figure it out! You can always choose elements of the syntax that are useful, and try some other approaches to see what works.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, there are two differences between this example and the prior one:\n",
    "1) Instead of selecting all the variables in a list for iterating, the independent variable '$i$' is defined as a list using the 'range' function. You may or may not want to use this yourself, but it's good to know the option exists! This simply tells the script to run the defined operation (that is, to append a value equivalent to $10i$ to the list) for the values i = 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 (not 11).\n",
    "\n",
    "2) You may not actually need an existing list like the one called \"numbers\" for your own solution, because you may not have any initial or preexisting values for 'y' to start with. But in order to append your results for 'y' to a list, you *do* need to first create an empty list where your code can save values (that is, give the code a destination for saving items):"
